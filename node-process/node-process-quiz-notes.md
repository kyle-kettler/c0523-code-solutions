## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a computer process?
  An instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads

- Roughly how many computer processes are running on your host operating system (Task Manager or Activity Monitor)?
  I would guess 200-300 at least

- Why should a full stack Web developer know that computer processes exist?
  Because full stack web development makes multiple process work together to form one application, so having an understanding of what is happening in the app is important.
