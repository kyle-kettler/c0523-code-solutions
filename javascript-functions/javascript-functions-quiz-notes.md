## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A named block of dynamic code that can be reused in multiple places.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword, optional name of the function, a comma-seperated list of parameters surrounded by parenteses, the code block surrounded by curly braces, an optional return statment.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The neame of the function, a comma-seperated list of arguments surrounded by parantheses. A funciton can be called without any arguments

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function call is only the name and the arguments, whereas the definition includes the code that runs when it is called. Functions have to be called after they are defined.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are used when the function is being defined, and arguments are used when the function is being called. Parameters are generic names, arguments are specific values.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They are essentially local variables that you can use in the function as placeholders. Then when you call the function you can populate the 'placeholders' with the arguments.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It causes the function to produce a value that can be used in the program, and it exits the function preventing any more code from being run.
